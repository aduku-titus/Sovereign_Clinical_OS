# 🏛️ SOVEREIGNTY & GOVERNANCE-AS-CODE
**Principal Architect:** Titus Afeo Azure Aduku  
**Standard:** Sovereign Clinical_OS v1.0

## 1. The "In-Situ" Mandate
Unlike conventional "Cloud-AI" health apps, the Sovereign Clinical_OS is architected for **In-Situ Inference**. 
- **The Moat:** Data is processed on physical silicon within the hospital's geographic boundaries. 
- **Migration Impact:** This bypasses the complexity of the US CLOUD Act, allowing immediate deployment in nations with strict data-export bans (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Germany).

## 2. Technical Safeguards (The 4 Pillars)

### Pillar I: Deterministic Logic Gates (Project 3)
We implement a **Litigation Shield**. Before any AI recommendation is displayed to a clinician, it must pass through a Pydantic-enforced "Cage." If a dose exceeds hard-coded Merck Manual thresholds, the system kills the process. 
- *Compliance:* UK NHS DCB0129 (Clinical Risk Management).

### Pillar II: SHA-256 Pseudonymization (Project 2)
Patient PII is hashed at the "Edge" using a salt-and-pepper deterministic algorithm. The AI agents only ever see a "Ghost ID." 
- *Compliance:* South Korea PIPA & EU GDPR Article 32.

### Pillar III: Offline Resilience (The Capstone)
The system is tested for **Total Air-Gap functionality**. In the event of a national grid failure or cyber-warfare, the hospital’s Geriatric Triage and FHIR documentation remain 100% operational.
- *Compliance:* National Health Security (Global).

### Pillar IV: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interoperability (Project 4)
No AI agent can finalize a discharge summary. Our "Clinician-Override" dashboard ensures a nurse or doctor must physically sign off on the HL7 FHIR R5 output.
- *Compliance:* Australia AHPRA & US HIPAA Technical Safeguards.

## 3. Regulatory Preparedness
This dossier serves as the technical validation for the 2026 migration window, targeting:
- **Middle East:** UAE Law 45 / Saudi PDPL.
- **Asia-Pacific:** Australia My Health Record / Singapore PDPA.
- **Europe:** Swiss FADP / Ireland HSE Framework.
