USA: HIPAA & FDA SaMD Framework
45 CFR § 164.312 (Technical Safeguards):
Implementation: Access control is enforced via containerized identity gates. Audit controls are maintained via an immutable local hash-chain log of every "Nurse-Approve" event.
FDA Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): To mitigate "Stochastic Drift," the Litigation Shield uses "Locked Models" with temperature=0.0 and Pydantic validation to ensure predictable, repeatable clinical outputs.
