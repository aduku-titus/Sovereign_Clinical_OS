South Korea: PIPA (2023 Amendment)
Article 28-2 (Pseudonymization): Permits data use for research without consent if pseudonymized.
Implementation: The OS generates "Sovereign Ghost IDs." This allows clinical data to be utilized for secondary PhD/R&D analysis within the hospital without risking re-identification of Korean citizens.
