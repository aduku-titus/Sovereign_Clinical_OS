# Compliance: South Korea PIPA
**Focus:** Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)

## Alignment Overview
South Korea has some of the world's strictest privacy laws. Our OS aligns with the **PIPA (2023 Amendment)**.

## Key Statutory Alignments
1. **Pseudonymization (Article 28-2):** The **SovereignScrubber** creates "Ghost IDs," allowing for the use of health data for R&D/PhD purposes without re-identification.
2. **Offline Inference:** Directly satisfies Korean requirements for the protection of sensitive bio-information by ensuring zero cloud-sync.
3. **Automated Auditing:** Logs every instance of data access by the **Agentic Swarm**.
