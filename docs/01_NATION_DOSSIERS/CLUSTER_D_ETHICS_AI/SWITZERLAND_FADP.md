# Compliance: Switzerland Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)
**Focus:** Privacy by Design and Data Control

## Alignment Overview
As of the **New FADP (September 2023)**, Switzerland enforces strict "Privacy by Design."

## Key Statutory Alignments
1. **Privacy by Design (Project 2):** The architecture inherently limits data processing to the absolute minimum necessary (Data Minimization).
2. **Local Control:** Allows Swiss Cantonal hospitals to retain 100% control over their data, bypassing the risks of the US CLOUD Act.
3. **High Security Standards:** Uses **SHA-256 hashing** for all patient indexing, fulfilling the FADP requirement for pseudonymization of sensitive health data.
