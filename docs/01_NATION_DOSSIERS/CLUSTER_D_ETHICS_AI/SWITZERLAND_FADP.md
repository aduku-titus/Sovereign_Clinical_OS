Switzerland: New FADP (2023)
Privacy by Design: The entire OS architecture is a "Privacy-by-Design" artifact. By removing the Cloud entirely, 90% of Switzerland's Federal Act on Data Protection risks are eliminated.
Implementation: SHA-256 indexing ensures that patient records are indexed by hashes, fulfilling Swiss requirements for the pseudonymization of "High-Privacy" health data.
