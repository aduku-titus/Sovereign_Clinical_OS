Australia: My Health Record & AHPRA
HI Service Interoperability: Uses HL7 FHIR R5 Observation resources to ensure data captured via Edge Vision can flow seamlessly into the Australian My Health Record ecosystem.
AHPRA Guidelines: Ensures AI is "Assistive, not Autonomous."
Implementation: Project 4 (Agent Swarm) includes a mandatory Practitioner-Sign-Off gate. No clinical record is created without an explicit AHPRA-registered practitioner's digital signature.
