# 🏥 SOVEREIGN CLINICAL_OS
**Principal Architect:** Titus Afeo Azure Aduku  
**Strategic Window:** 2026 Migration Cycle (UAE, Australia, Switzerland, UK)  
**Status:** Air-Gapped / Offline-First / Production-Ready

## 🌐 The Governance-as-Code Dossier
This is a unified clinical operating system built to bypass the "Public Cloud Dependency" of modern healthcare. By integrating Computer Vision, Local LLMs, and Deterministic Logic, this OS provides National Health Security in an era of cyber-instability.

### 🏗️ 4 Pillars of Sovereignty
1. **Edge Vision Bridge:** Offline digitization of legacy analog vitals.
2. **Sovereign Vault:** Local RAG and SHA-256 PII scrubbing (UAE Law 45 / PIPA compliant).
3. **Litigation Shield:** Pydantic-enforced clinical safety gates (NHS DCB0129 compliant).
4. **Agentic Swarm:** LangGraph-driven triage and FHIR R5 discharge automation.
